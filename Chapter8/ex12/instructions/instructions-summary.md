## Summary	
Jason, Samantha, Ravi, Sheila, and Ankit are preparing for an upcoming marathon. Each day of the week, they run a certain number of miles and write them into a notebook. At the end of the week, they would like to know the number of miles run each day and average miles run each day.
## Instructions 
Write a program to help them analyze their data. Your program must contain parallel arrays: an array to store the names of the runners and a two-dimensional array of five rows and seven columns to store the number of miles run by each runner each day. 
Furthermore, your program must contain at least the following functions: 
* a function to read and store the runnersâ€™ names and the numbers of miles run each day; 
* a function to calculate the average number of miles run each day; 
* and a function to output the results. 
(You may assume that the input data is stored in a file and each line of data is in the following form: **runnerName milesDay1 milesDay2 milesDay3 milesDay4 milesDay5 milesDay6 milesDay7**.)
