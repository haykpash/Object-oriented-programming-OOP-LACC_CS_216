## Instructions
Define the `class bankAccount` to implement the basic properties of a bank account. An object of this `class` should store the following data: Account holderâ€™s name (`string`), account number (`int`), account type (`string`, checking/saving), balance (`double`), and interest rate (`double`). (Store interest rate as a decimal number.) Add appropriate member functions to manipulate an object. Use a `static` member in the `class` to automatically assign account numbers. Also, declare an array of 10 components of type `bankAccount` to process up to 10 customers and write a program to illustrate how to use your `class`.

Example output is shown below:

```

2: Enter 2 for an existing customer.                                 
3: Enter 3 to print customers data.                                  
9: Enter 9 to exit the program.
