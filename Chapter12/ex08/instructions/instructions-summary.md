## Instructions
The function `remove` of the `class arrayListType` removes only the first occurrence of an element. Add the function `removeAll` as an abstract function to the `class arrayListType`, which would remove all occurrences of a given element. Also, write the definition of the function `removeAll` in the `class unorderedArrayListType` and write a program to test this function.
