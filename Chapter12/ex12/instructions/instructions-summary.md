## Instructions
**Unordered Sets** |As explained in this chapter, a set is a collection of distinct elements of the same type. Design the `class` `unorderedSetType`, derived from the `class` `unorderedArrayListType`, to manipulate sets.  

Note that you need to redefine only the functions `insertAt`, `insertEnd`, and `replaceAt`. If the item to be inserted is already in the list, the functions `insertAt` and `insertEnd` output an appropriate message, such as `13 is already in the set`. Similarly, if the item to be replaced is already in the list, the function `replaceAt` outputs an appropriate message. Also, write a program to test your class.
