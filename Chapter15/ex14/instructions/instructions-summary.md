## Instructions ##

Write a recursive function to implement the recursive algorithm of *Exercise 16* (reversing the elements of an array between two indices). Also, write a program to test your function. Your program should prompt the user for the integers in the array, as well as the low index and then the high index. The instructions from *Exercise 16*  have been included below for your convenience:

Suppose that `intArray` is an array of integers, and `length` specifies the number of elements in `intArray`. Also, suppose that `low` and `high` are two integers such that 0 <= low < length, 0 <= high < length, and low < high. That is, `low` and `high` are two indices in `intArray`. Write a recursive definition that reverses the elements in `intArray` between `low` and `high`.
