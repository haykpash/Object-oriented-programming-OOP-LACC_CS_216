## Instructions ##
Write a recursive function, `power`, that takes as parameters two integers `x` and `y` such that `x` is nonzero and returns x<sup>y</sup> . You can use the following recursive definition to calculate x<sup>y</sup>. 
 
### If y &#8805; 0:

Also, write a program to test your function. This program should prompt the user to enter a base number, `x`, followed by an exponent, `y` and outputs the result.
