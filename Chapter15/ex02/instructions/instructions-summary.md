## Instructions ##

Write a recursive function to generate the following pattern of stars:
    
        *
       * *
      * * *
     * * * *
      * * *
       * *
        *

Also, write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of lines in the pattern and uses the recursive function to generate the pattern. For example, specifying 4 as the number of lines generates the above pattern.
