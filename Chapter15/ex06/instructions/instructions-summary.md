## Instructions ##

A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forward and backward. For example, the `string` **madam** is a palindrome. Write a program that uses a recursive function to check whether a `string` is a palindrome. Prompt the user for a `string`. If the `string` is a palindrome output a message in the following format:

     madam is a palindrome

else 

     Hello is not a palindrome

Your program must contain a value-returning recursive function that returns `true` if the `string` is a palindrome and `false` otherwise. Do not use any global variables; use the appropriate parameters.
