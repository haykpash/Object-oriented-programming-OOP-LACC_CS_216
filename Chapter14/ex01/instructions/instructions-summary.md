## Instructions ##

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a length in feet and then enter a length in inches and outputs the equivalent length in centimeters. If the user enters a negative number or a non-digit number, throw and handle an appropriate exception and prompt the user to enter another set of numbers. 

Your error message should read **A non positive number is entered** and allow the user to try again. 

> Format your output with `setprecision(2)` to ensure the proper number of decimals for testing!
